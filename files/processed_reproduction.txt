As you are aware, humans are sexually reproducing and viviparous. The reproductive events in humans include formation of gametes (gametogenesis), i.e., sperms in males and ovum in females, transfer of sperms into the female genital tract (insemination) and fusion of male and female gametes (fertilisation) leading to formation of zygote. This is followed by formation and development of blastocyst and  its  attachment  to  the  uterine  wall  (implantation), embryonic development (gestation) and delivery of the baby (parturition). You have learnt that these reproductive events  occur  after  puberty.  There  are  remarkable differences between the reproductive events in the male and in the female, for example, sperm formation continues even in old men, but formation of ovum ceases in women around the age of fifty years. Let us examine the male and female reproductive systems in human. 
The male reproductive system is located in the pelvis region .  It  includes  a  pair  of  testes  alongwith accessory ducts, glands and the external genitalia. 
The testes are situated outside the abdominal  cavity  within  a  pouch called scrotum. The scrotum helps in maintaining the low temperature of the testes (2–2.5o C lower than the  normal  internal  body temperature)  necessary  for spermatogenesis. In adults, each testis is oval in shape, with a length of about 4 to 5 cm and a width of about  2  to  3  cm.  The  testis  is covered by a dense covering. Each testis has about 250 compartments called  lobules testicular  . 
Each  lobule  contains  one  to three  highly  coiled  seminiferous tubules  in  which  sperms  are produced. Each seminiferous tubule is lined on its inside by two types of  cells  called  male  germ  cells (spermatogonia) and Sertoli cells . The male germ cells undergo  meiotic  divisions  finally leading to sperm formation, while Sertoli cells provide nutrition to the germ cells. The regions outside the seminiferous  tubules  called interstitial  spaces,  contain  small blood vessels and interstitial cells or Leydig cells . Leydig cells  synthesise  and  secrete testicular  hormones  called androgens. Other  immunologically competent cells are also present. 
The male sex accessory ducts include rete testis, vasa efferentia, epididymis and vas deferens . The seminiferous tubules of the testis open into the vasa efferentia through rete testis. The vasa efferentia leave the testis and open into epididymis located along the posterior surface of each testis. The epididymis leads to vas deferens that ascends to the abdomen and loops over the urinary bladder. It receives a duct from seminal vesicle and opens into urethra as the ejaculatory duct . These ducts store and transport the sperms from the testis to the outside through urethra. The urethra originates from the urinary bladder and extends through the penis to its external opening called urethral meatus. 
The penis is the male external genitalia . It is made up of special tissue that helps in erection of the penis to facilitate insemination. The enlarged end of penis called the glans penis is covered by a loose fold of skin called foreskin. 
The male accessory glands  include paired seminal vesicles, a prostate and paired bulbourethral glands. Secretions of these glands constitute the seminal plasma which is rich in fructose, calcium and certain enzymes. The secretions of bulbourethral glands also helps in the lubrication of the penis. 
The female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries alongwith a pair of oviducts, uterus, cervix, vagina and the external genitalia located in pelvic region . These parts of the system alongwith a pair of the mammary glands are integrated structurally and functionally to support the processes of ovulation, fertilisation, pregnancy, birth and child care. 
Ovaries are the primary female sex organs that produce the female gamete  (ovum)  and  several  steroid  hormones  (ovarian  hormones). The  ovaries  are  located  one  on  each  side  of  the  lower  abdomen . Each ovary is about 2 to 4 cm in length and is connected to the pelvic wall and uterus by ligaments. Each ovary is covered by a thin epithelium which encloses the ovarian stroma. The stroma is divided into two zones – a peripheral cortex and an inner medulla. 
The oviducts (fallopian tubes), uterus and vagina constitute the female accessory ducts. Each fallopian tube is about 10-12 cm long and extends from the periphery of each ovary to the uterus , the part closer to  the  ovary  is  the  funnel-shaped  infundibulum.  The  edges  of  the infundibulum possess finger-like projections called fimbriae, which help in collection of the ovum after ovulation. The infundibulum leads to a wider 
part of the oviduct called ampulla. The last part of the oviduct, isthmus has a narrow lumen and it joins the uterus. 
The uterus is single and it is also called womb. The shape of the uterus is like an inverted pear. It is supported by ligaments attached to the pelvic wall. The uterus opens into vagina through a narrow cervix. The cavity of the cervix is called cervical canal  which alongwith vagina forms the birth canal. The wall of the uterus has three layers of tissue. The external thin membranous  perimetrium,  middle  thick layer of smooth muscle, myometrium and inner glandular layer called endometrium that lines the uterine cavity. The endometrium undergoes cyclical changes during menstrual cycle while the myometrium exhibits strong contraction during delivery of the baby. 
The female external genitalia include mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, hymen and clitoris . Mons pubis is a cushion of fatty tissue covered by skin and pubic hair. The labia majora are fleshy folds of tissue, which extend down from the mons pubis and surround the vaginal opening. The labia minora are paired folds of tissue under the labia majora. The opening of the vagina is often covered partially by a membrane called hymen. The clitoris is a tiny finger-like structure which lies at the upper junction of the two labia minora above the urethral opening.  The hymen is often torn during the first coitus (intercourse). However, it can also be broken by a sudden fall or jolt, insertion of a vaginal tampon, active participation in some sports like horseback riding, cycling, etc. In some women the hymen persists even after coitus. In fact, the presence or absence of hymen is not a reliable indicator of virginity or sexual experience. 
A functional mammary gland is characteristic of all female mammals. The  mammary  glands  are  paired  structures  (breasts)  that  contain glandular tissue and variable amount of fat. The glandular tissue of each breast is divided into 15-20 mammary lobes containing clusters of cells called alveoli . The cells of alveoli secrete milk, which is stored in the cavities (lumens) of alveoli. The alveoli open into mammary tubules. The tubules of each lobe join to form a mammary duct. Several mammary ducts  join  to  form  a  wider  mammary  ampulla  which  is  connected  to lactiferous duct through which milk is sucked out. 
The primary sex organs – the testis in the males and the ovaries in the females – produce gametes, i.e, sperms and ovum, respectively, by the process called gametogenesis. In testis, the immature male germ cells (spermatogonia) produce sperms by spermatogenesis that begins at puberty.  The spermatogonia (sing. spermatogonium) present on the inside wall of seminiferous tubules multiply by mitotic division and increase in numbers. Each spermatogonium is diploid and contains 46 chromosomes.  Some  of  the  spermatogonia  called  p r i m a r y spermatocytes periodically undergo meiosis. A primary spermatocyte completes  the  first  meiotic  division  (reduction  division)  leading  to formation of two equal,  haploid cells called secondary  spermatocytes,  which  have only 23 chromosomes each. The secondary spermatocytes undergo the second meiotic division  to  produce  four  equal,  haploid spermatids . What would be the number of chromosome in the spermatids? The  spermatids  are  transformed  into spermatozoa  (sperms)  by  the  process called  After s p e r m i o g e n e s i s.  spermiogenesis,  sperm  heads  become embedded in the Sertoli cells, and are finally released from the seminiferous tubules by the process  called spermiation. 
Spermatogenesis  starts  at  the  age  of puberty  due  to  significant  increase  in  the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). This, if you recall, is a hypothalamic hormone. The increased levels of GnRH then acts at the anterior pituitary gland and stimulates secretion of two gonadotropins – luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).  LH acts at the Leydig cells and stimulates synthesis and secretion of androgens. Androgens, in turn, stimulate the process of spermatogenesis. FSH acts on the Sertoli cells and stimulates 
secretion  of  some  factors  which  help  in  the process of spermiogenesis. 
Let us examine the structure of a sperm. It is a microscopic structure composed of a head, neck, a middle piece and a tail . A plasma membrane envelops the whole body of sperm. The sperm head contains an elongated haploid nucleus, the anterior portion of which is covered by a cap-like structure, acrosome. The acrosome is filled with enzymes that help fertilisation  of  the  ovum.  The  middle  piece possesses  numerous  mitochondria,  which produce energy for the movement of  tail that facilitate sperm motility essential for fertilisation. The human male ejaculates about 200 to 300 million  sperms  during  a  coitus  of  which, for normal  fertility, at least 60 per cent sperms must have normal shape and size and at least 40  per  cent  of  them  must  show  vigorous motility. 
Sperms  released  from  the  seminiferous tubules,  are  transported  by  the  accessory ducts.  Secretions  of  epididymis,  vas  deferens,  seminal  vesicle  and prostate are essential for maturation and motility of sperms. The seminal plasma along with the sperms constitute the semen. The functions of male sex accessory ducts and glands are maintained by the testicular hormones (androgens). 
The process of formation of a mature female gamete is called oogenesis which is markedly different from spermatogenesis. Oogenesis is initiated during the embryonic development stage when a couple of million gamete mother cells (oogonia) are formed within each fetal ovary; no more oogonia are formed and added after birth. These cells start division and enter into prophase-I of the meiotic division and get temporarily arrested at that stage, called primary oocytes. Each primary oocyte then gets surrounded by a layer of granulosa cells and is called the primary follicle . A large number of these follicles degenerate during the phase from birth to puberty. Therefore, at puberty only 60,000-80,000 primary follicles are left in each ovary. The primary follicles get surrounded by more layers of granulosa cells and a new theca and are called secondary follicles. 
The secondary follicle soon transforms into a tertiary follicle which is characterised by a fluid filled cavity called antrum. The theca layer is organised into an inner theca interna and an outer theca externa. It is important to draw your attention that it is at this stage that the primary oocyte within the tertiary follicle grows in size and completes its first meiotic division. It is an unequal division resulting in the formation of a large haploid secondary oocyte and a tiny first polar body . The 
secondary  oocyte  retains  bulk  of  the nutrient rich cytoplasm of the primary oocyte. Can you think of any advantage for this? Does the first polar body born out of first meiotic division divide further or degenerate?  At present we are not very  certain  about  this.  The  tertiary follicle further changes into the mature follicle or Graafian follicle . The  secondary  oocyte  forms  a  new membrane  called  zona  pellucida surrounding it. The Graafian follicle now ruptures to release the secondary oocyte (ovum)  from  the  ovary  by  the process  called  ovulation.  Can  you identify  major  differences  between spermatogenesis  and  oogenesis?    A  diagrammatic  representation  of spermatogenesis and oogenesis is given below . 
The reproductive cycle in the female primates (e.g. monkeys, apes and human beings) is called menstrual cycle. The first menstruation begins at puberty and is called menarche. In human females, menstruation is repeated at an average interval of about 28/29 days, and the cycle of events starting from one menstruation till the next one is called the menstrual cycle. One ovum is released (ovulation) during the middle 
of each menstrual cycle. The major events of the menstrual cycle are shown in Figure 2.9. The cycle starts with the menstrual phase, when menstrual flow occurs and it lasts for 3-5 days. The menstrual flow results due to breakdown of endometrial lining of the uterus and its blood  vessels  which  forms  liquid  that  comes  out  through  vagina. Menstruation only occurs if the released ovum is not fertilised. Lack of menstruation may be indicative of pregnancy. However, it may also be caused due to some other underlying causes like stress, poor health etc. The  menstrual  phase  is  followed  by  the  follicular  phase.  During this  phase,  the  primary  follicles  in  the  ovary  grow  to  become  a fully  mature  Graafian  follicle  and  simultaneously  the  endometrium of  uterus  regenerates  through  proliferation.  These  changes  in  the ovary  and  the  uterus  are  induced  by  changes  in  the  levels  of pituitary  and  ovarian  hormones  .  The  secretion  of 
gonadotropins (LH and FSH) increases gradually during the follicular phase, and stimulates follicular development as well as secretion of estrogens by the growing follicles. Both LH and FSH attain a peak level in the middle of cycle (about 14th day). Rapid secretion of LH leading to its maximum level during the mid-cycle called LH surge induces rupture of Graafian follicle and thereby the release of ovum (ovulation). The ovulation (ovulatory phase) is followed by the luteal phase during which the remaining parts of the Graafian follicle transform as the corpus luteum  .  The  corpus  luteum  secretes  large  amounts  of progesterone which is essential for maintenance of the endometrium. Such an endometrium is necessary for implantation of the fertilised ovum and other events of pregnancy. During pregnancy all events of the menstrual cycle stop and there is no menstruation.  In the absence of fertilisation, the corpus luteum degenerates. This causes disintegration of the endometrium leading to menstruation, marking a new cycle.  In human beings, menstrual cycles ceases around 50 years of age; that is termed as menopause. Cyclic menstruation is an indicator of normal reproductive phase and extends between menarche and menopause. 
During copulation (coitus) semen is released by the penis into the vagina (insemination). The motile sperms swim rapidly, pass through the cervix, enter  into  the  uterus  and  finally  reach  the  ampullary  region  of  the fallopian tube . The ovum released by the ovary is also transported to the ampullary region where  fertilisation  takes  place. Fertilisation  can  only  occur  if  the ovum  and  sperms  are  transported simultaneously  to  the  ampullary region.  This is the reason why not all copulations lead to fertilisation and pregnancy. 
The process of fusion of a sperm with an ovum is called fertilisation. During fertilisation, a sperm comes in contact with the zona pellucida layer of the ovum   and induces changes in the membrane  that block the entry of additional sperms.  Thus, it  ensures  that  only  one  sperm  can fertilise an ovum.  The secretions of the acrosome help the sperm enter into the cytoplasm  of  the  ovum  through  the zona  pellucida  and  the  plasma 
membrane.  This  induces  the  completion  of  the  meiotic  division  of  the secondary oocyte. The second meiotic division is also unequal and results in the formation of a second polar body and a haploid ovum (ootid). Soon the haploid nucleus of the sperms and that of the ovum fuse together to form a diploid zygote.  How many chromosomes will be there in the zygote? One has to remember that the sex of the baby has been decided at this stage itself. Let us see how? As you know the chromosome pattern in the human female is XX and that in the male is XY. Therefore, all the haploid gametes (ova) produced by the female have the sex chromosome X whereas in the male gametes (sperms) the sex chromosome could be either X or Y, hence, 50 per cent of sperms carry the X chromosome while the other 50 per cent carry the Y. After fusion of the male and female gametes the zygote would carry either XX or XY depending on whether the sperm carrying X or Y fertilised the ovum. The zygote carrying XX would develop into a female baby and XY would form a male (you will learn more about the chromosomal patterns in Chapter 5). That is why, scientifically it is correct to say that the sex of the baby is determined by the father and not by the mother! 
The mitotic division  starts as the zygote moves through the isthmus of the oviduct called cleavage towards the uterus  and forms 2, 4, 8, 16 daughter cells called blastomeres. The embryo with 8 to 16 
blastomeres is called a morula . The morula continues to divide and transforms into blastocyst  as it moves further into the uterus. The blastomeres in the blastocyst are arranged into an outer layer called trophoblast and an inner group of cells attached to trophoblast called the inner cell mass. The trophoblast layer then gets attached to the endometrium and the inner cell mass gets differentiated as the embryo. After attachment, the uterine cells divide rapidly and covers the  blastocyst.  As  a  result,  the  blastocyst  becomes  embedded  in  the endometrium of the uterus . This is called implantation and it leads to pregnancy. 
After implantation, finger-like projections appear on the trophoblast called chorionic villi which are surrounded by the uterine tissue and maternal blood. The chorionic villi and uterine tissue become interdigitated with each  other  and  jointly  form  a  structural  and  functional  unit  between developing embryo (foetus) and maternal body called placenta . The  placenta  facilitate  the  supply  of  oxygen  and  nutrients  to  the embryo and also removal of carbon dioxide and excretory/waste materials produced by the embryo. The placenta is connected to the embryo through an umbilical cord which helps in the transport of substances to and from the embryo. Placenta also acts as an endocrine tissue and produces several hormones like human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), human placental lactogen (hPL), estrogens, progestogens, etc. In the later phase  of  pregnancy,  a  hormone  called  relaxin  is  also  secreted  by the  ovary.  Let  us  remember that  hCG,  hPL  and  relaxin are  produced  in  women only  during  pregnancy.  In addition,  during  pregnancy the levels of other hormones like estrogens, progestogens, cortisol, prolactin, thyroxine, etc.,  are  increased  several- folds  in  the  maternal  blood. Increased production of these hormones  is  essential  for supporting  the  fetal  growth, metabolic  changes  in  the mother  and  maintenance  of pregnancy. 
Immediately  
after implantation,  the  inner  cell mass  (embryo)  differentiates 
into an outer layer called ectoderm and an inner layer called endoderm. A mesoderm soon appears between the ectoderm and the endoderm. These three layers give rise to all tissues (organs) in adults. It needs to be mentioned here that the inner cell mass contains certain cells called stem cells which have the potency to give rise to all the tissues and organs. 
What are the major features of embryonic development at various months of pregnancy?  The human pregnancy lasts 9 months. Do you know for  how many months pregnancy last in dogs, elephants, cats? Find out. In human beings, after one month of pregnancy, the embryo’s heart is formed. The first sign of growing foetus may be noticed by listening to the  heart sound carefully through the stethoscope. By the end of the second month of pregnancy, the foetus develops limbs and digits. By the end of 12 weeks (first trimester), most of the major organ systems are formed,  for  example,  the  limbs  and  external  genital  organs  are  well- developed. The first movements of the foetus and appearance of hair on the head are usually observed during the fifth month. By the end of about 24 weeks (end of second trimester), the body is covered with fine hair, eye-lids separate, and eyelashes are formed.  By the end of nine months of pregnancy, the foetus is fully developed and is ready for delivery. 
The  average  duration  of  human  pregnancy  is  about  9  months which is called the gestation period. Vigorous contraction of the uterus at the end of pregnancy causes expulsion/delivery of the foetus. This process of  delivery  of  the  foetus  (childbirth)  is  called  parturition.  Parturition  is induced  by  a  complex  neuroendocrine  mechanism.  The  signals  for parturition  originate  from  the  fully  developed  foetus  and  the  placenta which induce mild uterine contractions called foetal ejection reflex. This triggers release of oxytocin from the maternal pituitary. Oxytocin acts on the  uterine  muscle  and  causes  stronger  uterine  contractions,  which  in turn stimulates further secretion of oxytocin. The stimulatory reflex between the  uterine  contraction  and  oxytocin  secretion  continues  resulting  in stronger and stronger contractions. This leads to expulsion of the baby out  of  the  uterus  through  the  birth  canal  –  parturition.  Soon  after  the infant is delivered, the placenta is also expelled out of the uterus. What do you  think  the  doctors  inject  to  induce  delivery? 
The mammary glands of the female undergo differentiation during pregnancy and starts producing milk towards the end of pregnancy by the process called lactation. This helps the mother in feeding the new- born. The milk produced during the initial few days of lactation is called colostrum  which  contains  several  antibodies  absolutely  essential  to develop resistance for the new-born babies. Breast-feeding during the initial period of infant growth is recommended by doctors for bringing up a healthy baby.
